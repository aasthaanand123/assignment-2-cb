notes 
    - header contains 2 sections-- navigation bar and display bar for introduction 
    - navigation bar contains 2 sections-- logo section and links section 
    - flexbox applied in complete nav bar, logo section and links section separately

flexbox
    1. align items vs align content: 
    align items aligns the items relative to each other when size of items are different
    align content manages space between lines when items wrap 
    2. flex flow
    shorthand of flex-direction and flex wrap
    3. justify content vs align items
    Justify content: longer word so horizontal alignment
    Align items: shorter word so vertical alignment

doubts:
        - how to maintain the image aspect ratio?
        - what is align self and how does it help in positioning an element as sticky?  --main doubt  (line 245 css)
